## Overview

Cyber Assistant v4.0 offers a modern, dynamic approach to digital investigations and AI-powered chat. With its clean design, responsive animations, and interactive controls, users can explore technical details or creative insights in a highly engaging environment.

---

## Features

- **Intelligent Chat:**  
  Engage with the assistant in multiple languages, switching between **Technical** (detailed) or **Freeform** (creative) responses.

- **Forensic Investigation:**  
  Search and analyze online data with configurable options like the number of websites, investigation focus (e.g., phishing, malware), and inclusion of news or leaked data.

- **Image Metadata Extraction:**  
  Extract EXIF metadataâ€”including automatic GPS coordinate conversion into clickable Google Maps links.

- **Neural Model Integration:**  
  Powered by the Mistral-7B-Instruct model (via `llama_cpp`), it offers context-aware responses and supports real-time language translation.

- **Local Caching:**  
  An in-memory cache minimizes redundant processing for repeated queries.

- **Customizable Interfaces:**  
  Choose between a classic Flask interface or a modern Gradio interface, each fully configurable to suit your needs.

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Integrated Prometheus metrics track request counts and response latencies.

---

## Project Architecture

Cyber Assistant v4.0 is built on a modular architecture:

- **Backend (Flask):**  
  Handles HTTP requests, integrates the neural model, and processes forensic and metadata extraction tasks.

- **Neural Model:**  
  Loaded via `llama_cpp` and automatically downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub if not available locally.

- **Front-end Interfaces:**  
  - **Flask Interface:** A traditional web UI with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and interactive animations.  
  - **Gradio Interface:** A modern UI delivering real-time feedback and dynamic animations.

- **Supporting Libraries:**  
  Uses libraries like `nltk`, `langdetect`, `duckduckgo_search`, and `Pillow` for language processing, search, and image analysis.
