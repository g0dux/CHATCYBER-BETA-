## Features ‚ú®

- **Intelligent Chat:**  
  Engage in conversations with the assistant in multiple languages. Choose between **Technical** (detailed) or **Freeform** (creative) responses.

- **Forensic Investigation:**  
  Perform online investigations using target queries to retrieve data from various websites. Configure options such as number of sites, investigation focus, and inclusion of news or leaked data.

- **Image Metadata Extraction:**  
  Analyze EXIF metadata from an image URL‚Äîincluding automatic GPS coordinate conversion that links to Google Maps.

- **Neural Model Integration:**  
  Powered by the Mistral-7B-Instruct model (via `llama_cpp`), the assistant generates context-aware responses and supports real-time language translation if needed.

- **Local Caching:**  
  An in-memory caching system optimizes performance by reducing redundant processing on repeated queries.

- **Interactive Web Interface:**  
  A responsive and modern front end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides a smooth user experience with customizable configurations.

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Prometheus integration tracks request counts and response latencies for robust performance insights.

## Project Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Cyber Assistant v4.0 is built with a modular architecture:

- **Backend (Flask):**  
  Handles user requests, interacts with the neural model, and manages forensic and metadata extraction functionalities.

- **Neural Model:**  
  Loaded using the `llama_cpp` library; if not available locally, it is automatically downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub.

- **Front-end:**  
  An interactive web interface that allows users to select modes, adjust parameters (such as temperature and response speed), and customize the appearance.

- **Supporting Libraries:**  
  Utilizes libraries such as `nltk`, `langdetect`, `duckduckgo_search`, and `Pillow` for text processing, image analysis, and data extraction.

---

## Installation and Setup üîß

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher**
- **Git** ‚Äì To clone the repository
- **Virtualenv** (Recommended for environment isolation)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/g0dux/CHATCYBER-BETA-.git
   cd cyber-assistant-v4
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   - **Linux/MacOS:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   _Main dependencies include:_  
   **Flask, nltk, langdetect, cachetools, requests, psutil, llama_cpp, huggingface_hub, duckduckgo_search, Pillow**

4. **Initial NLTK Setup:**

   On the first run, the project will download the required NLTK data (such as *punkt* and *vader_lexicon*).

---

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Start the application by executing:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask server will start at [http://0.0.0.0:5000/](http://0.0.0.0:5000/). Open your browser, navigate to the URL, and interact with Cyber Assistant v4.0.

---

## Operation Modes üéÆ

Cyber Assistant v4.0 offers three primary operation modes:

### Chat Mode üí¨

- **Description:**  
  Engage in a natural, conversational interaction with the AI assistant.
- **Features:**  
  - Choose your preferred language (Portugu√™s, English, Espa√±ol, Fran√ßais, Deutsch).
  - Select response style: **Technical** (detailed) or **Freeform** (creative).

---

### Investigation Mode üîç

- **Description:**  
  Conduct online investigations based on a target query.
- **Features:**  
  - Define the number of websites to search.
  - Specify a focused investigation area.
  - Enable options to include news and leaked data.
  - Adjust response speed: choose between ‚ÄúDetailed‚Äù (more comprehensive but slower) or ‚ÄúFast‚Äù (quicker with fewer details).
- **Output:**  
  Produces a detailed report with links, forensic analysis, and actionable insights.

---

### Metadata Mode üñºÔ∏è

- **Description:**  
  Extract and display image metadata from a provided URL.
- **Features:**  
  - Retrieve complete EXIF metadata.
  - Automatically convert GPS coordinates into a clickable Google Maps link (if available).

---

## Advanced Forensic Analysis üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Cyber Assistant v4.0 includes an advanced forensic analysis module that extracts and correlates critical data for digital investigations, such as:

- **IP Addresses:** IPv4 and IPv6  
- **Contact Information:** Emails and Phone Numbers  
- **URLs & MAC Addresses**  
- **Hashes:** MD5, SHA1, SHA256  
- **Vulnerability IDs:** e.g., CVE identifiers

These capabilities aid in identifying patterns and gathering digital evidence for cybersecurity and forensic investigations.

---

## Additional Features üöÄ

- **Autocorrection:**  
  The input text is automatically corrected for spelling and grammar to improve the coherence of responses.

- **Speed vs. Detail Configuration:**  
  Users can choose between a "Fast" mode (lower token count, less detailed, quicker responses) or a "Detailed" mode (higher token count, more comprehensive responses).

- **Interactive Configuration:**  
  The web interface includes a modal that lets users customize appearance settings (font sizes, colors, dimensions for chat and notes areas).

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Integrated with Prometheus to monitor key metrics such as request count and latency.
