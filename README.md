## Features ‚ú®

- **Intelligent Chat:**  
  Engage in conversations with the assistant in multiple languages, with options for **Technical** or **Freeform** (creative) responses.

- **Forensic Investigation:**  
  Perform online investigations using target queries to retrieve data from multiple websites. Enjoy detailed forensic analysis with actionable insights.

- **Image Metadata Extraction:**  
  Analyze EXIF metadata from an image URL, including automatic GPS coordinate conversion that integrates with Google Maps.

- **Neural Model Integration:**  
  Powered by the Mistral-7B-Instruct model (via `llama_cpp`), the assistant generates context-aware responses and performs real-time language translations when needed.

- **Local Caching:**  
  Utilizes an in-memory caching system for faster response times on repeated queries, optimized for Windows environments.

- **Interactive Web Interface:**  
  A responsive, modern front end built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures a smooth user experience.

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Integrated with Prometheus, the tool tracks request counts and response latencies for robust performance analysis.

## Project Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Cyber Assistant v4.0 is designed with a modular architecture:

- **Backend (Flask):**  
  Manages user requests, communicates with the neural model, and handles forensic analysis and image metadata extraction.

- **Neural Model:**  
  Loaded using the `llama_cpp` library; if not available locally, it‚Äôs automatically downloaded from the Hugging Face Hub.

- **Front-end:**  
  An interactive web interface allowing mode selection and configuration, enabling dynamic user interactions.

- **Supporting Libraries:**  
  Utilizes powerful libraries like `nltk`, `langdetect`, `duckduckgo_search`, and `Pillow` to support language processing, image analysis, and data extraction.
