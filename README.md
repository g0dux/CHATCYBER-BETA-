## Features ‚ú®

- **Intelligent Chat:**  
  Engage in conversations with the assistant in multiple languages. Choose between **Technical** (detailed) or **Freeform** (creative) responses.

- **Forensic Investigation:**  
  Perform online investigations using target queries to retrieve data from various websites. Configure options such as the number of sites, investigation focus, and inclusion of news or leaked data.

- **Image Metadata Extraction:**  
  Analyze EXIF metadata from an image URL‚Äîincluding automatic GPS coordinate conversion that links directly to Google Maps.

- **Neural Model Integration:**  
  Powered by the Mistral-7B-Instruct model (via `llama_cpp`), the assistant generates context-aware responses and supports real-time language translation if necessary.

- **Local Caching:**  
  An in-memory caching system minimizes redundant processing for repeated queries.

- **Customizable Interfaces:**  
  Both the Flask and Gradio interfaces are highly configurable with options to adjust appearance, response speed, and detail level.

- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Integrated with Prometheus to track request counts and response latencies.

## Project Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Cyber Assistant v4.0 is built using a modular architecture:

- **Backend (Flask):**  
  Handles HTTP requests, integrates with the neural model, and manages forensic analysis and metadata extraction.

- **Neural Model:**  
  Loaded using the `llama_cpp` library; automatically downloads the model from the Hugging Face Hub if it is not found locally.

- **Front-end:**  
  Two distinct interfaces are provided:
  - **Flask Interface:** A classic web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - **Gradio Interface:** A modern, interactive UI powered by Gradio that offers a user-friendly experience with real-time feedback.

- **Supporting Libraries:**  
  Leverages libraries such as `nltk`, `langdetect`, `duckduckgo_search`, and `Pillow` for text processing, language detection, web search, and image analysis.

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

Start the application by running:

```bash
python app.py
```

The Flask server will start at [http://0.0.0.0:5000/](http://0.0.0.0:5000/). Open your browser, navigate to the URL, and interact with Cyber Assistant v4.0.

---

## Operation Modes üéÆ

Cyber Assistant v4.0 offers three primary modes:

### Chat Mode üí¨

- **Description:**  
  Engage in natural, interactive conversation with the AI assistant.

- **Configuration:**  
  - Choose your preferred language and response style.
  - Adjust the AI's temperature and response speed to balance creativity and performance.

---

### Investigation Mode üîç

- **Description:**  
  Conduct online investigations based on target queries.

- **Configuration:**  
  - Define the number of websites to search.
  - Specify a focus for the investigation (e.g., phishing, malware).
  - Enable options to include news or leaked data.
  - Choose between "Detailed" (more comprehensive but slower) and "Fast" (quicker with fewer details) response modes.

- **Output:**  
  Generates a report with forensic analysis, relevant links, and actionable insights.

---

### Metadata Mode üñºÔ∏è

- **Description:**  
  Extract and display image metadata from a provided URL.

- **Features:**  
  - Retrieve complete EXIF data.
  - Automatically convert GPS coordinates to a clickable Google Maps link.

---

## Flask Interface

The Flask interface is the classic web interface powered by Flask. It handles HTTP requests and renders pages using server-side templates. Key aspects include:

- **Endpoints:**  
  Multiple endpoints handle chat, investigation, metadata extraction, email analysis, and more.
  
- **Performance Monitoring:**  
  Integrated with Prometheus for tracking metrics.
  
- **Customization:**  
  Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive design with a configuration modal to adjust appearance settings.

---

## Gradio Interface

The Gradio interface provides an interactive, modern user interface that runs alongside Flask. Key features include:

- **Real-Time Interaction:**  
  Users receive immediate feedback as they interact with the assistant.
  
- **Intuitive Controls:**  
  Sliders and radio buttons allow users to configure parameters such as temperature, response speed, and more.
  
- **Seamless Integration:**  
  The Gradio interface mirrors the functionalities available in the Flask interface, providing a user-friendly experience for both chat and investigation modes.

---

## Advanced Forensic Analysis üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The advanced forensic analysis module extracts critical forensic data from the results, including:

- **IP Addresses:** IPv4 and IPv6  
- **Contact Information:** Emails and phone numbers  
- **URLs, MAC Addresses, and Hashes:** MD5, SHA1, and SHA256  
- **Vulnerability IDs:** Such as CVE identifiers

This module aids in identifying patterns and gathering digital evidence for cybersecurity investigations.
